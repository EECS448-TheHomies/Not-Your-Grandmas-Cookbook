    step: Add about 2 teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of pepper. Or do what I always
      do for dishes that call for salt and pepper. I use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper.
      Give it a good sprinkle, about 1 tablespoon of it. Set aside to marinate for
      a couple of hours.Slice the top of the tomatoes off.Using a small spoon, scoop
      out the soft insides of the tomatoes. This reduces the moisture in the dish
      and prevents sogginess.Chop the tomatoes up into small bits.Chop the onions
      into small bits.

    , and Pinot Noir. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot\
    \ noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling ros\xE9 is a safe pairing\
    \ too. The Barefoot Cellars Riesling Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems\
